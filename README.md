# php-blog-example

There are three folder in this project:

* Backend for our PHP
* Frontend for our frontend code (JS/React?)
* Database for our SQL code

# Architecture 

This is an example of a decoupled app.  The backend will be written in PHP and the frontend will be written in React.  The backend will serve up data with a JSON REST API, and the frontend will consume that data to display it.
